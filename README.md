# Plugin Privacy for Chrome
Stop your browser plugins from being fingerprinted or interrogated. Protect your privacy by hiding navigator.plugins and navigator.mimeType.

##Why ?
Your list of plugins can help identify your browser and allows you to be tracked. See https://panopticlick.eff.org

##Installation
I'm not in the mood to pay Google the $5 for Chrome Web Store registration today so for now we will use an unpacked extension.

1. Clone the repo somewhere ```git clone https://github.com/bcaller/plugin-privacy-chrome.git```
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable developer mode
4. Click Load unpacked extension
5. Select the plugin-privacy-chrome folder
6. Also optionally check the box "Allow in incognito" next to the Plugin Privacy
